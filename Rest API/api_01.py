#Application Programming Interface :
======================================
Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, are commonly used to retrieve
data from remote websites. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook all offer 
certain data through their APIs. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web 
server, and retrieve the data you need.
=================================
But why use an API instead of a static dataset you can download? APIs are useful in the following cases:
1. The data is changing quickly. An example of this is stock price data. 
2. It doesn't really make sense to regenerate a dataset and download it every minute -- 
3. This will take a lot of bandwidth, and be pretty slow.
4. You want a small piece of a much larger set of data. Reddit comments are one example.
5. What if you want to just pull your own comments on Reddit? It doesn't make much sense
to download the entire Reddit database, then filter just your own comments.
6. There is repeated computation involved. Spotify has an API that can tell you 
the genre of a piece of music. You could theoretically create your own classifier,
and use it to categorize music, but you'll never have as much data as Spotify does.
==================================
API Requests :- 
1. APIs are hosted on web servers. When you type www.google.com in your browser's address bar, 
your computer is actually asking the www.google.com server for a webpage, which it then returns to your browser.
2. APIs work much the same way, except instead of your web browser asking for a webpage, 
your program asks for data. This data is usually returned in JSON format 
3. In order to get the data, we make a request to a webserver. 
The server then replies with our data. In Python, we'll use the requests library to do this.
===================================
Type of requests : 
There are many different types of requests. 
The most commonly used one, a GET request, is used to retrieve data.
We can use a simple GET request to retrieve information from the OpenNotify API.
===================================
Python Request Libarary : 
1.The Requests library for Python is one of the most downloaded Python packages of 
all time and probably one of my favourite libraries. It's one of those packages that
abstracts so much away from what's actually happening underneath that you'll almost be 
fooled into thinking you're the one doing all the hard work.
2. You can use Requests to send human-readable HTTP/1.1 requests without the need 
for loads of configuration beforehand. Here's an example of just how simple it is to use:
===================================
import requests
r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))
print(r.status_code)  # 200
print(r.headers['content-type'])  # 'application/json'
=====================================
Types of HTTP methods :
Before we move on to making our own requests, lets quickly make sure we're all on the same page.
There are four common HTTP methods that you are likely to use on a regular basis. These are:
1. GET - retrieves information from the chosen source.
2. POST - sends new information to the chosen source.
3. PUT - updates existing information of the chosen source.
4. DELETE - removes existing information from the chosen source
=======================================
1. Most of the time you will probably find yourself using GET requests because you'll 
just be asking for information from the database of a specific source, like the titles 
of every film released in 2017 from a well-known internet movie database.
2. You are more likely to use PUSH, PUT and DELETE requests for APIs where 
you own an account, such as Twitter or Github. These APIs will allow you to 
send requests to add or delete tweets/repositories using your account credentials.
===========================================
The structure of a HTTP request :
As well as the four HTTP methods, it's important to understand the anatomy 
of the HTTP request itself. There are three key parts of a HTTP request:
1. The request line - this part contains the request method (i.e. GET, POST, etc) 
and the URL of the resource the request is searching for.
2. The header - this part sends additional information to the chosen source, such as 
the type of encoding (e.g. UTF-8) and the desired content type (e.g. 'application/json').
3. The body - this part is optional, but when using the POST or PUT methods the data 
required for the update is contained here.
==========================================
The request line -->
The Header -->
The body --> (optional but in case of post or put, it require data)
==========================================
>>> r = requests.get('http://swapi.co/api/planets/1/')
The first thing to confirm is whether the request was successful, 
which you can do by checking the status_code of the response:
>>> r.status_code
200
A status code of 200 is the standard response of a successful HTTP request. 
If you get a code other than 200 and you aren't getting the response from the API 
you were expecting, it's worth finding out what the status code means to help you 
figure out what you need to do to fix your request. 
================================================

https://letscodepython.com/blog/2017/10/11/apis-and-python-requests-library/ #api docs
================================================
Headers :
Our HTTP request was successful, so we can now look at what the API sent back to us.
You can view the response headers using .headers:
>>> r.headers
{'Via': '1.1 vegur', 'Content-Encoding': 'gzip', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked', 'Set-Cookie':
'__cfduid=d92acebf1060281dbc7a56a74b79e0f101494793395; expires=Mon, 14-May-18 20:23:15 GMT; 
path=/; domain=.swapi.co; HttpOnly', 'Vary': 'Accept, Cookie', 'Server': 'cloudflare-nginx', 
'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'Etag': 'W/"167b2ef894493c72d59ba5a45bab88cf"', 'Allow': 'GET, HEAD,
OPTIONS', 'Date': 'Sun, 14 May 2017 20:23:15 GMT', 'X-Frame-Options': 'SAMEORIGIN', 'Content-Type': 
'application/json', 'CF-RAY': '35f09301b6326a37-LHR'}
======================================
This gives us useful information like the content-type and the allowed request methods,
which in this case are application/json and GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, respectively.
=======================================
Encoding :
You can view the encoding of the response with .encoding, however, Swapi doesn't 
use encoding for its responses, so to test this we are going to send a GET 
request to httpbin.org instead:
========================================
>>> r2 = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/')
>>> r2.encoding
'utf8'
====================================
By default the Request library will guess the encoding type of the response, 
which will most often be utf8 and decode it accordingly, but you can change
the encoding type yourself like the following:
>>> r2.encoding = 'ISO 8859-1'
=================================
Contents :
Now for the juicy bit of the response, the content.
You can check the contents of the response using .text, or if the response 
is in the format of JSON, the .json() method:
==========================
>>> r.text
u'{"name": "Tatooine", "rotation_period": "23", "orbital_period": "304", "diameter": 
"10465", "climate": "arid", "gravity": "1 standard", "terrain": "desert"...[remainder of response truncated]}'
>>> r.json()
{u'diameter': u'10465', u'climate': u'arid', u'surface_water': u'1', u'name': u'Tatooine',
u'created': u'2014-12-09T13:50:49.641000Z'...[remainder of response truncated]}
=============================
The key (and possibly obvious) difference between the above is that .
text will return the contents as a unicode string, whilst the .json() 
method will return a JSON object. This means with the second option, 
we can use Python dictionary notation to obtain specific content in the request:
===================================
>>> data = r.json()
>>> data['name']
u'Tatooine'
=====================================
This is useful if you are only interested in writing code that extracts certain information held by the API.
r = requests.post('https://requestb.in/15qihl81', data={'name': 'nemo'})
Here we've used the Requests library to send a POST request using the 
post method, and as well as providing the URL we want to send the request to 
we have also included some data we want the request to include.
Just as we did for the GET request, let's test the status code of the response:
>>> r.status_code
200
And if we check the content of the response, we should see something like this:
>>> r.text
u'ok'
====================================
Status codes :
The request we just made had a status code of 200. Status codes are returned with 
every request that is made to a web server. Status codes indicate information about what 
happened with a request. Here are some codes that are relevant to GET requests:
200 -- everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any)
301 -- the server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name
is changed.
401 -- the server thinks you're not authenticated. This happens when you don't send the right credentials to access an API (we'll talk 
about authentication in a later post).
400 -- the server thinks you made a bad request. This can happen when you don't send along the right data, among other things.
403 -- the resource you're trying to access is forbidden -- you don't have the right permissions to see it.
404 -- the resource you tried to access wasn't found on the server.
============================================
The json library has two main methods:
1. dumps -- Takes in a Python object, and converts it to a string.
2. loads -- Takes a JSON string, and converts it to a Python object.
